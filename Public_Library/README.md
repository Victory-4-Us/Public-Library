"Public_Library.java"
Cole

***Description***
This program acts as a simple interface for a public library. 
The user can create and customize a profile, and checkout and return items
The library uses inherited classes to allow for a bigger expansion in future updates
The library uses exception handling to work with varied user input
The library uses abstract classes to allow for customized outputs within similar classes

***Potential updates***
1. using assigned age types (youth, teen, adult), certian library materials could be restricted to younger users
2. library could be updated to use arrays for better media data handling
3. main menu could be more robust when it comes to browsing and searching items in the library
